MattyG's State Machine
======================

This is a fork of the Symfony Workflow component. It retains a lot of the core
ideas of the Symfony component, but makes a couple of rather important
adjustments. The most prominent of this is the removal of support for entities
that can be in multiple states simultaneously. Each entitiy can only be in one
state at a time.

You can find the original documentation for the Symfony component at the
following URL:

https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/workflow.html

It's still somewhat relevant, and should hopefully tide you over until I've had
a chance to write proper documentation myself!
